The Vikings were a Nordic people who lived in the oceans and coastal regions. They are known to be mercenary sailors capable of moving and attacking anywhere in the sea with their long and flexible boats.
During the Middle Ages, Viking wars at sea spread throughout Europe and North America, attacking settlements, cities, and even merchant ships. They became enemies of many European countries, especially Britain, France and Denmark.
The Viking wars at sea came to an end in the early 11th century after the Norwegian captain Leif Erikson discovered the Americas, and European countries began to transition to the era of imperialism and search for territories. new land at sea.

When a player attacks a tile on the opponent's board, if that tile contains part of a ship, the opponent must report the hit and which part of the ship was destroyed. If all parts of a ship are destroyed, the player will announce the destruction of the ship and gain points.
